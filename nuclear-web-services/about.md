# About

Nuclear Web Services is a monorepo containing services augmenting the user experience with Nuclear by adding optional functionalities that cannot be achieved by a local program alone, such as the ability to store and share playlists online.

These services can be hosted independently, but by default Nuclear will use the officially maintained instances.
