# Committing and resolving merge conflicts

When you finish working on something, make sure you're only adding files you modified. Don't use `git add -A`.

If you create a pull request and there are merge conflicts, only attempt to resolve them yourself if you're sure you know how to do it. If you're unsure, the project maintainers will be happy to help you, you just need to give us write access to your branch by checking a checkbox in your PR.
