# Translating

Translations are now managed on Crowdin.

You can suggest new translations here: [https://crowdin.com/project/nuclear](https://crowdin.com/project/nuclear)

You can also proofread and approve existing ones. Crowdin has a built-in machine translation engine and it suggests translations with a good accuracy, so you only have to click to add them.
